\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Given its proximity, size, and complexity, $\omega$~Centauri (NGC 5139) has become one of the most well-studied Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) \citep{2002ASPC..265.....V}. It has a mass of approximately $4 \times 10^6~M_{\odot}$ \citep{2013MNRAS.429.1887D}, and a tidal radius of 88~pc \citep{2005MNRAS.360..631M}. \ocen's close proximity to Earth \citep[$d \sim 5.5$~kpc, e.g.][]{2006ApJ...652..362D, 2001AJ....121.3089T} allows us to resolve the stellar population of this dense cluster. 

Although it has been subject to decades of investigations, the true nature of \ocen remains unclear. It is one of the most massive GGCs orbiting the Milky Way. It is significantly flattened \citep[$\epsilon = 1 - b/a = 0.17$][]{2005MNRAS.360..631M} and it does not show the levels of mass segregation in its stellar population that would be expected were it in equipartition \citep{2002ASPC..265...87A}. Additionally, \ocen was the first GGC discovered to comprise more than one stellar population \citep{1999Natur.402...55L}, breaking down the prevailing interpretation that GGCs were simple stellar populations with a single episode of star formation, hence a monolithic age and metallicity distribution.

There are at least seven distinct stellar populations in \ocen \citep{2016MNRAS.457.4525T}, with a spread in metallicity as large as $0.8$ to $1.4$~dex \citep{2014ApJ...791..107V, 2012ApJ...746...14M, 2010ApJ...722.1373J}. As all the stars in \ocen are at approximately the same distance from Earth\footnote{In this case, the spread in distance due to the depth of the cluster is negligible.}, it is the ideal testbed for studying the effects of changing metallicity on a population.

In this work we focus on the effects of changing metallicity on the RR Lyrae variables (RRL), specifically examining whether the period--luminosity (PL) relations in the near-- and mid--infrared (IR) are affected, and the magnitude of any such effects. \ocen has been used previously for such studies, ranging from empirical tests in the optical \citep[e.g.][]{2003MNRAS.345...86O, 1991ApJ...373L..43L} and near--IR \citep[e.g.][]{2006MmSAI..77..245C, 2006ApJ...652..362D}, to semi--empirical tests using population synthesis techniques \citep{2016MNRAS.457.4525T}. 

This work is part of the Carnegie RR Lyrae Program (CRRP), a Warm {\it Spitzer} Exploration Science program with the aim of provide an independent, Population II anchor to the extragalactic distance scale. Tied to RR Lyrae variables with high--precision, geometric distances in the Milky Way, the CRRP will ultimately provide a single instrument measurement of $H_{0}$, independent of Cepheid measurements, putting important constraints on the external accuracy of the standard candle distance ladder, and the internal consistency of the distance measurements of Cepheids and RR Lyrae variables.
 
 Although observing RRL at mid--IR wavelengths dramatically reduces the effects of reddening and extinction \citep[$A_{[3.6]} \sim A_V / 16$][]{2005ApJ...619..931I}, a consensus has not been reached on the consequences of this shift to longer wavelengths on the metallicity term in the empirical RRL PL relation. Both theory and observation have demonstrated that the position of the horizontal branch in the optical colour--magnitude diagram is dependent on metallicity \citep[e.g.][]{2015ApJ...808...50M, 2004ApJS..154..633C, 2003MNRAS.344.1097B, 1994AJ....108..222N}. However, the size of the metallicity contribution in the infrared PL relation is yet to be settled in the literature, either from a theoretical or empirical standpoint. 
 
The most in--depth study of the effect of metallicity on the mid--IR PL relation to date comes from \citet{2014MNRAS.439.3765D}, who used WISE data \citep{2010AJ....140.1868W, 2013wise.rept....1C} to examine possible changes in the RRL PL relation in globular clusters with different metallicities. They found a moderate metallicity dependence of the [W1]\footnote{approximately equivalent to {\it Spitzer} $3.6~\mu$m band} PL relation, with $\gamma_{W1} = 0.106 \pm 0.023$~mag~dex$^{-1}$, slightly larger than their value for the near--IR, and approximately half that of the optical dependence \citep[$\gamma_{K} = 0.088 \pm 0.026$~mag~dex$^{-1}$, $\gamma_{V} = 0.232 \pm 0.020$~mag~dex$^{-1}$,][]{2013MNRAS.435.3206D}. The observational work of \citet{2015ApJ...807..127M} appears to confirm this result, favouring a low value of $\gamma_K$ for Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud RRL. However, the empirical study of \citet{2015AJ....150...90K} considers near--IR observations of RRL in the Carina dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxy, this time testing different PL relations with a range of metallicity coefficients. Their results favour a larger value for $\gamma_K$ than \citet{2015PKAS...30..183D}, with average values of $\gamma_K \approx 0.18$~mag~dex$^{-1}$. This is consistent with the theoretical models by \citet{2015ApJ...808...50M}, who find that the metallicity dependence of the infrared PL relation is just as large as at optical wavelengths.

Our study is unique as it is the first study to use \ocen to empirically measure the metallicity effect on the mid--IR RRL PL relation using metallicities of individual stars, rather than comparing the populations of RRL in different GGCs or dSph. Our approach --- studying only {\it differential photometric effects} --- removes the systematic uncertainties introduced by comparing populations at different distances with different levels of foreground extinction, and in some cases observed with different instruments.

The paper is set out as follows: Section~\ref{sec:observations} details the observations and data reduction. Section~\ref{sec:results} presents the photometry of the \ocen RRL. Section~\ref{sec:pl_relation} describes the mid-IR PL relations and Section~\ref{sec:distance_moduli} discusses the application of these to a distance measurement of  \ocen. Section~\ref{sec:metallicity} examines the effects of metallicity on RRL magnitudes and distance estimates. Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses the implications of this, and other systematic effects we consider in this work. In Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we present our conclusions.


%In the era of `precision cosmology' it is important to fully understand all sources of uncertainty in our experiments. Although the results distance ladder measurements such as \citet{2011ApJ...730..119R} and \citet{2012ApJ...758...24F} agree very well, 
%%at $74.4\pm 2.5$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$ and $74.3\pm2.6$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$, respectively, 
%when we consider the latest results from {\it Planck} 
%%who find $67.48\pm0.98$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$ \citep{2015arXiv150201589P},
% there is tension. The {\it Planck} study derives its measurement from a model of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), so is completely independent of the \citeauthor{2011ApJ...730..119R} and \citeauthor{2012ApJ...758...24F} results. Works such as \citet{2015ApJ...802...20R} and \citet{2014MNRAS.440.1138E} have examined the contribution of systematic uncertainties at the far end of the distance ladder to this tension. The CRRP is quantifying the systematic uncertainty in the standard candle distance ladder by making meaningful comparisons at the base of the Cepheid and RR Lyrae distance ladders in the mid--infrared, where distance measurements of similar precision are achievable. 

% A good local standard candle \citep[as defined by][]{1986ApJ...303....1A} has the following  features: a)~a physical basis, b)~objective measurable, c)~minimal corrections, and d)~small scatter. RR Lyrae variables (hereafter RRL) are excellent standard candles in the mid--infrared. As \citet{1986MNRAS.220..279L} demonstrated, unlike at optical wavelengths where their absolute magnitudes depend only on metallicity, in the infrared RRL follow a clear period--luminosity (PL) relation. The PL relation has a physical basis (i.e. the PL relation is directly linked to the period--radius relation), and both the period and luminosity of the RRL can be objectively measured. In the mid--IR minimal extinction corrections are required \citep[$A_{[3.6]} \approx A_{V}/16$,][]{2005ApJ...619..931I}, and the dispersion of the relation in the infrared has been shown to be small compared to optical wavelengths \citep{2015ApJ...808...50M, 2004ApJS..154..633C}. Through this decrease in dispersion we have found that the intrinsic width of the mid-IR PL for RRL is in fact \emph{smaller} than for Cepheids -- less than 0.05~mag compared to 0.10~mag \citep{2015ApJ...808...11N, 2011ApJ...743...76S}. This translates to a distance uncertainty for an individual RRL of below 2\% for RRL, compared to 4\% for Cepheids, at 3.6\um. Thus, for nearby systems RRL are the most precise standard candles.



%RR Lyrae variables (hereafter RRL) are intrinsically fainter than Cepheids, and in the optical follow a much shallower, even horizontal, PL relation \citep{2004ApJS..154..633C}. Determining an accurate distance to an RRL in the $V$ band requires knowledge of its metallicity. However, \citet{1986MNRAS.220..279L} showed that the true power of RRL as distance indicators lies in the IR passbands. Recently, several groups have been studying the populations of RRL in globular clusters and nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the infrared \citep[e.g.][and references therein]{2013ApJ...767...62G, 2014ApJ...786..147O, 2015ApJ...806..200C, 2015A&A...578A.128K}. Several Galactic RRL now have high precision geometric distances measured as part of the HST-Fine Guidance Sensor (HST-FGS) parallax program \citep{2011AJ....142..187B}, and can therefore be used to calibrate the absolute zero-point of the RRL PL relation.% and \textit{HST} parallaxes were obtained for several Galactic RRL calibrators \citep{2011AJ....142..187B}, where calibrators are RRL whose distances can be determined by both parallax and period-luminosity fitting. {\bf (Is that right? Should I be more general and say any object whose distance can be determined by more than one distance ladder method?)}

%Distance measurements made in the mid-IR benefit from reduced extinction effects, where $A_{[3.6]}$ and $A_{[4.5]}$ are 16 to 20 times lower than $A_V$ \citep{1989ApJ...345..245C, 2005ApJ...619..931I}. Additionally, the precision of distances obtained from the RRL PL relation is increased. At the wavelengths observed by Warm \textit{Spitzer} (3.6 and 4.5\um) we do not see photospheric effects, but only the effects of temperature driving the pulsation; essentially, the mid-infrared light curve is tracing the change in radius of the star through the pulsation cycle. A by-product of this effect is that the intrinsic width of the RRL PL relation is also minimised in the mid-IR. The PL relation for pulsational variables can be thought of as a two-dimensional projection of the three-dimensional period-luminosity-colour relation (see figure 3 of \citet{1991PASP..103..933M} for a graphical representation). As the effects of temperature are reduced, the colour-width of the PL decreases in the mid-IR. As one moves from the optical to the mid-IR, the slope of the PL relation steepens and its dispersion dramatically decreases; the slope should asymptotically approach the predicted slope of the period-radius relation, resulting in a slope between $-2.4$ and $-2.8$, confirmed empirically by \citet{2013ApJ...776..135M}. Through this decrease in dispersion we have found that the intrinsic width of the mid-IR PL for RRL is in fact \emph{smaller} than for Cepheids -- less than 0.05~mag compared to 0.10~mag \citep{2015ApJ...808...11N}. This translates to an uncertainty on an individual RRL of below 2\%, compared to 4\% for Cepheids. Thus, for nearby systems RRL are the most precise standard candles.
%
%In this work we focus on the effects of metallicity on the RRL PL relation in the mid-infrared. Several Galactic Globular Clusters are being observed as part of CRRP, but \ocen is unique in that it exhibits a measurable spread in metallicity \citep{1975ApJ...201L..71F, 2007ApJ...663..296V, 2014ApJ...791..107V}.
%
%There are very few metallic or molecular transition lines in the mid-IR at typical RRL temperatures, so the effects of metallicity on luminosity should be minimised. However, \ocen provides the ideal environment for a direct empirical test. Such an effect is not out of the realm of possibility; for example, the strength of the CO band head at 4.5\um has been found to have a significant effect on Cepheid colours \citep{2010ApJ...709..120M}, and has such prevented the IRAC 4.5\um Cepheid observations from being used for distance measurements in the CHP \citep{2011ApJ...743...76S, 2012ApJ...759..146M, 2016ApJ...816...49S}. Our concern in this program is systematic precision, and therefore we must test for any potential effects directly.

\section{Observations \& Data Reduction}
\label{sec:observations}
This work combines mid-IR observations from the CRRP Warm {\it Spitzer} program with supporting near-IR observations from the FourStar instrument \citep{2013PASP..125..654P} on the Baade-Magellan telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Figure~\ref{fig:omegaCen_fields} shows a $K_s$-band FourStar image with the {\it Spitzer} fields outlined, and the positions of known RRL from \citet{2004A&A...424.1101K} indicated by circles (fundamental mode, RRab) or triangles (first overtone, RRc).

The circular points are RRab's and the triangular points are RRc's; we adopt this convention throughout the paper. The three black rectangle outlines are the IRAC field of view for each pointing in the 3.6\um channel, and the white rectangle outlines show the same for 4.5\um.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{{\em Spitzer} Data}
\label{sec:spitzer_reduction}
The \textit{Spitzer} observations for this work were taken as part of the CRRP \citet[][{\it Spitzer} PID 90002]{2012sptz.prop90002F}. Three fields in \ocen were chosen; their positions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:omegaCen_fields}. To obtain optimal RRL light curves we observed each field 12 times over approximately 16 hours (0.67~days), roughly corresponding to the longest period RRL we expected in the field and ensuring full phase coverage of all RRL. The observations of all three fields were taken on 2013 May 10 and 2013 May 11. Each field was observed using the {\it Spitzer} InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) \citep{2004ApJS..154...10F} with a 30~s frame time with a medium scale, gaussian 5-point dither pattern to mitigate any image artefacts. Images were collected in both the 3.6 and 4.5\um channels. 
The elongated field shapes come from the design of IRAC; while the [3.6] channel is collecting on-target data, the [4.5] channel collects off target data ``for free'', and vice versa. We chose to include these off-target fields to maximise the number of RRL in our final sample and to increase the legacy value of our data set to the community. 

The science images were created using \textsc{mopex} \citep{2006SPIE.6274E..0CM}, first running overlap correction on the corrected basic calibrated data frames (cBCDs) then mosaicking the original, under--sampled 1.2 arcsec scale images to a scale of 0.6 arcsec/pixel using the drizzle algorithm. Mosaicked location-correction images were created at the same time. The science mosaics have a signal to noise of approximately 100 at the brightness level of the RRL in both bands. 

% say resolution/FWHM
PSF photometry was performed on the mosaicked images using {\sc daophot} and {\sc allframe} \citep{1987PASP...99..191S, 1994PASP..106..250S}. The PSF model was created for each field/filter combination using the first epoch data and was applied to every epoch. As the observations were taken temporally close together the effects of telescope rotation between epochs on the mosaicked PSF were minimal, so making a single good PSF model for each field/filter combination proved to be more efficient and just as accurate as creating one for every epoch. 

Master star lists for {\sc allframe} were created for each filter/field combination using a median mosaicked image created by {\sc mopex}. We did not use the same single master star list for both filters as only a small proportion ($1/3$) of the [3.6] and [4.5] fields overlap each other. Instead we performed separate {\sc allframe} reductions for each filter, and combined the results after the fact using {\sc daomatch} and {\sc daomaster}. Our mid-IR photometry is calibrated to the standard system set by \citet{2005PASP..117..978R}.

\subsection{FourStar Data}
\label{sec:fourstar_reduction}

$J$, $H$ and $K_s$ data were taken with the FourStar instrument on the Baade-Magellan telescope at Las Campanas Observatory \citep{2013PASP..125..654P} on the nights of 2013 June 25, 2013 June 27, and 2013 June 28. Four epochs were obtained each night in each filter for a total of 12 epochs, with a typical image quality of $\text{FWHM} =0.6$ arcseconds in the $K_{S}$ band. A mosaic of $5\times3$ slightly overlapping pointings (tiles), each with FourStar's native $10.9 \times 10.9$ arc-minute field of view, covered a $50\times30$ arc-minute field of view centred on \ocen. Each tile consists of a 5 point dither pattern with a 5.8 second exposure time. Stacked mosaics of the entire field were made as well as individual tiles using a customised pipeline for FourStar data. The purpose of the individual tiles is to provide photometry with better time resolution than the large mosaic. 

PSF photometry of the tiles was performed using \textsc{daophot} and \textsc{allframe} \citep{1987PASP...99..191S, 1994PASP..106..250S}. A PSF model was created for each epoch/tile/filter combination. A master star list for \textsc{allframe} was created from the final $K_s$ mosaic and the multi-wavelength/epoch results were combined using \textsc{daomatch} and \textsc{daomaster}. Our final photometry is calibrated to the 2MASS standard system \citep{2006AJ....131.1163S}.

% The primary limiting factor in the photometric precision is crowding. To assess crowding for individual RRLs, we compared the {\it Spitzer} images to the higher resolution FourStar $K_s$-band image. The 0.159 arcsec/pixel scale of the $K_s$-band image compared to the 0.6 arcsec/pixel scale of the IRAC images enabled us to more accurately determine which stars were significantly contaminated. RRL were determined to be contaminated if there were one or more resolved stars in the $K_s$-band image within a 3.6 arc-second (6 resampled IRAC pixels) radius of the RRL. 77 RRLs out of the original \citet{2004A&A...424.1101K} catalog of 192 were rejected due to crowding. Another 13 were outside the FourStar mosaic field of view, and four more were found to be unusable due to other image artefacts.

Our final photometry catalog, including magnitudes and uncertainties for $J\!H\!K_s$, [3.6], and [4.5], is presented in Table~\ref{tab:everything}.

%Our full, uncrowded RRL sample consists of 96 stars in $J$ and $H$, 98 in $K_s$, 38 in [3.6], and 42 in [4.5]; the small number of RRL in the IRAC bands compared to the FourStar bands is due to the smaller coverage of the IRAC pointings (see Figure~\ref{fig:omegaCen_fields}) and crowding effects due to IRAC's lower resolution. For the PL fitting, detailed in Section~\ref{sec:pl_relation}, we use only the stars for which we have photometry in all five bandpasses, ensuring that the same range of periods and metallicities are sampled for each wavelength. This helps to reduce any biases that may be introduced by non--uniform sampling in the distance moduli fits in Section~\ref{sec:distance_moduli}. Our final RRL sample consists of 24 stars, with 12 each of RRab's and RRc's.

\section{Period-Luminosity Relations}
\label{sec:pl_relation}

We fit PL relations of the form \begin{equation}
\label{eqn:pl}
m = a \times (\log P - \langle \log P \rangle) + b,
\end{equation}
where $\langle \log P \rangle$ is the average of the logarithms of the periods in the sample. For our sample of RRab in \ocen, $\langle \log P \rangle = -0.190$ days, and for RRc $\langle \log P \rangle = -0.450$ days. We use a simple linear least-squares fit unweighted by photometric errors to fit this relation to our photometry, and report the parameters $a$ and $b$ as well as the dispersion $\sigma$ in Table~\ref{tab:pl_table}.

%We fit PL relations using the theoretical near-infrared PL relation parameters presented in \citet{2015ApJ...808...50M} for the $JHK_s$ bands, and the empirical PL relation parameters derived from photometry of RRLs in the globular cluster M4 (NGC 6121) from \citet{2015ApJ...808...11N} for the IRAC bands. With the use of preexisting PL relation coefficients, the distance modulus becomes the only free parameter in our fit. We fit all distance moduli using an unweighted least-squares method, and fit the distance modulus to each pulsation mode in each wavelength separately. We also refine the fit by sigma-clipping the residuals of the [3.6] fit at a $2\sigma$ level, resulting in the rejection of two more stars.
%
%For the mid-IR we use the PL relations from \citet{2015ApJ...808...11N}, as described in Table~\ref{tab:pl_table_m4}. These relations take the form
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eqn:neeley_pl}
%M = a + b \times (\log (P) -  \log(P_0))
%\end{equation}
%where $a$ and $b$ are empirically derived coefficients and $P_0$ is the absolute value of the logarithm of the mean period of the M4 RRL sample. We calculate the absolute PL zero-points, $a$, by adopting \citeauthor{2015ApJ...808...11N}'s M4 distance modulus of $\mu=11.399$ mag.

%The theoretical PL relations for the near-IR have a metallicity-dependent term; however, we do not have empirically measured metallicities for all RRL in our sample. We therefore take the mean [Fe/H] of all 74 RRLs in \citet{2006ApJ...640L..43S}, obtaining a mean [Fe/H] value of $-1.677$.
%The distribution of the [Fe/H] values for the \ocen RRL are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:metallicity_hists}, for both the spectroscopic measurements by \citet{2006ApJ...640L..43S} and the photometric determinations by \citet{2000AJ....119.1824R}. The light blue shaded histograms indicate the full sample of stars for each catalogue, with the darker blue histograms denoting those in our sample. Figure~\ref{fig:metallicity_hists} demonstrates that our sample of RRL is a representative sample of the metallicity distribution of the RRL in \ocen.

%\section{Distance Moduli}
%\label{sec:distance_moduli}
%
%We combine the uncorrected distance moduli from each bandpass to obtain a mean reddening value and reddening-corrected distance modulus. We fit the near-infrared reddening law from \citet{1989ApJ...345..245C} to the $JHK_s$ data and the mid-infrared law from \citet{2005ApJ...619..931I} to [3.6] and [4.5] simultaneously, assuming a ratio of total to selective absorption $R_V = 3.1$. The resulting fit is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:omegaCen_dist_m4_mean}. We derive a mean dereddened distance modulus of $\langle \mu_0 \rangle = 13.789 \pm 0.018$ with $E(B-V) = 0.084 \pm 0.030$ using the weighted mean RRab + RRc distance moduli. The individual uncorrected distance moduli $\mu$, corrected distance moduli $\mu_0$, and PL residuals are shown in Table~\ref{tab:dist_mod}.

%It is apparent from Figure~\ref{fig:omegaCen_dist_m4_mean} that there are large discrepancies in the distance moduli in [3.6] and [4.5] for the two pulsation modes; these discrepancies contribute to the relatively low $E(B-V)$ value and high dereddened distance modulus compared to previously determined values \citep[e.g.][]{2002ASPC..265...95L, 2006ApJ...652..362D}. % 0.11 and whatever the fuck distance moduli
%If we remove the RRc's and fit the extinction curve only to the RRab's, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:omegaCen_dist_m4_ab}, we obtain a better fit of all points to the extinction curve than when we use the mean. From these distance moduli we derive a dereddened distance modulus of $\langle \mu_0 \rangle = 13.743 \pm 0.026$ with $E(B-V) = 0.138 \pm 0.044$, both of which are closer to accepted values than the values derived from the weighted mean distance moduli. All individual corrected distance moduli from this fit are shown in Table~\ref{tab:dist_mod_ab}.
%
%Given the large errors in the [4.5] distance moduli, we also fit the extinction curve to the $JHK_s$ and [3.6] distances only, excluding [4.5] entirely; this was found to have a negligible effect on the final derived distance modulus and reddening for both the mean and RRab-only measurements. %say what it is

\section{Metallicity}
\label{sec:metallicity}

In principle, moving from the optical to the mid--infrared in uncrowded systems should bring the advantage of a steeper PL relation with decreased dispersion. However, theoretical works suggest that the metallicity coefficient in the infrared PL relations should be comparable to the metallicity coefficient at optical wavelengths \citep{2001MNRAS.326.1183B, 2004ApJS..154..633C, 2015ApJ...808...50M}. 
 $\omega$ Cen is ideal for assessing the contribution of metallicity to the mid--IR RRL PL relation, because it is known to have a large spread in metallicity \citep[$0.8~\leq~\Delta~\text{[Fe/H]}~\leq~1.4$~dex][]{2014ApJ...791..107V, 2012ApJ...746...14M, 2010ApJ...722.1373J}. A metallicity spread this wide is not found in any other Galactic globular cluster. 

One of the advantages of using globular clusters to calibrate PL coefficients is that all stars in a cluster can be considered to be at the same distance. The dispersion in the PL relation is a combination of the a) the intrinsic dispersion of the PL relation, b) the photometric uncertainties, and c) dispersion induced by other complicating factors such as the spread in metallicity. %Justify using M4 scatter - low crowding, whatever the fuck, copy overview paper
Since we have a measured ``intrinsic" dispersion of the RRL PL in [3.6] and [4.5] from the cluster M4 \citep{2015ApJ...808...11N} and the photometric uncertainties are well understood, we can isolate the remaining scatter due to astrophysical sources such as metallicity. 

It has been shown with mid-IR spectra that a significant CO feature sits within the IRAC [4.5] filter. In the case of Cepheids, \citet{2016MNRAS.459.1170S} have shown that this has a significant effect on the [4.5] magnitudes, and is metallicity dependent. However, this effect decreases with increasing temperatures, turning off completely above 6000~K where all the CO has been destroyed \citep{2016MNRAS.459.1170S}. As even the coolest RRL have temperatures over 6000~K \citep{1971PASP...83..697I}, we expect to see no such CO absorption affecting the [4.5] PL relation, nor do we expect any other temperature dependent (hence period dependent) metallicity effects. However, we can directly and empirically test this prediction. %If there are any other unanticipated metallicity effects for RRL, they must be smaller than the dispersion of the PL relations themselves, but we must still perform empirical tests to search for such effects.

\subsection{Metallicity Contribution to the Overall Dispersion}
\label{sec:dispersions}

We can place an upper limit on the contribution of metallicity to the \ocen PL dispersion using the known variances of the individual components: the observed distribution of \ocen PL residuals $\sigma_{\text{observed}}^2$, the intrinsic PL width $\sigma_{\text{intrinsic}}^2$, and the dispersion induced by photometric error $\sigma_{\text{phot}}^2$. The dispersion contributed by metallicity can therefore be constrained as follows:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_\text{[Fe/H]} \leq \sqrt{\sigma_{\text{observed}}^2 - \sigma_{\text{intrinsic}}^2 - \sigma_{\text{phot}}^2}
\end{equation}

Table~\ref{tab:metallicity_sigma} shows the estimated contribution to the dispersion from metallicity $\sigma_{[Fe/H]}$ in each band, alongside the contributions from the photometric uncertainties and intrinsic components \citep[from][for the near-- and mid--IR, respectively]{2015ApJ...808...50M, 2015ApJ...808...11N}. %We note that this procedure is robust despite the inclusion of the metallicity term, $c$, in the near--IR PL relations (Equation~\ref{eqn:marconi_pl} and Table~\ref{tab:pl_table_theo}), as this is a constant term multiplied by a single [Fe/H] applied to each RRL uniformly, while the methodology described in this section studies the differential effects of the varying metallicities in \ocen.

We use these estimates of $\sigma_\text{[Fe/H]}$ to assess the $\gamma$ parameter for \ocen, where 
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:gamma}
\gamma = \dfrac {\Delta \text{mag}} {\Delta [\text{Fe/H}]}\text{ mag dex} ^{-1}\text{,}
\end{equation}
similar to $\gamma$ used to quantify the effect of metallicity on the zero-point of the Cepheid PL relation \citep{1998ApJ...498..181K, 2009MNRAS.396.1287S}. Here we calculate $\gamma$ in units of mag~dex$^{-1}$ by dividing the standard deviation of the metallicity component of the PL scatter by the standard deviation of the metallicity distribution for both \citep{2006ApJ...640L..43S} and photometric \citep{2000AJ....119.1824R} metallicities; the results for each PL are shown in Table~\ref{tab:gamma}. We use all available metallicity values for each pulsation mode when taking the standard deviation, as we do not have metallicity values for all the stars in our samples, although the metallicity values we do have trace the overall metallicity distributions fairly well (see Figure~\ref{fig:metallicity_hists}).

It is important to note that these values presented in Tables~\ref{tab:metallicity_sigma} and \ref{tab:gamma} are upper limits, and as we will show in Sections~\ref{sec:residuals} and~\ref{sec:discussion}, the size of the effect that can be attributed to metallicity effects alone may be much smaller. 

%For [3.6] we find $\gamma \leq 0.455$ mag~dex$^{-1}$ for RRab's, and $\gamma \leq 0.237$ mag~dex$^{-1}$ for RRc's. These values are upper limits, and as we will show in Sections~\ref{sec:residuals} and~\ref{sec:discussion}, the size of the effect that can be attributed to metallicity effects alone may be much smaller.

\subsection{PL Residuals and Individual Metallicities}
\label{sec:residuals}

\ocen provides a second approach to testing for a metallicity effect on the RRL PL relation. The cluster is well studied and many of its RRL have metallicity measurements in the literature \citep[e.g.][]{2006ApJ...640L..43S, 2000AJ....119.1824R, 2016arXiv160904916B}. \citet{2016arXiv160904916B} in particular provide several measurements of RRL metallicities, including revisions of metallicities from \citet{2006ApJ...640L..43S} and \citet{2000AJ....119.1824R}, and new estimates based on the residuals of the $I$-band PL relation. Here we choose to use their weighted average of the rescaled \citet{2006ApJ...640L..43S} and \citet{2000AJ....119.1824R} metallicities.

Theory predicts a linear metallicity term in the PLZ relation in the optical and infrared, $c\times[\text{Fe/H}]$.
We thus fit a relation of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:delta_mag}
\Delta\text{mag} = \gamma \times[\text{Fe/H}] + d
\end{equation}
to the PL residuals and metallicity values for stars with known metallicity values, as shown in Figures~\ref{fig:metallicity_residuals_j}, \ref{fig:metallicity_residuals_h}, \ref{fig:metallicity_residuals_k}, \ref{fig:metallicity_residuals_3}, and \ref{fig:metallicity_residuals_4}. The scatter in the [3.6] and [4.5] PL relations is higher for \ocen than it is for M4 \citep{2015ApJ...808...11N, 2015ApJ...799..165B}; however, when we examine [Fe/H] vs. the residuals of each PL relation, $\gamma$ is within $2\sigma$ of zero for all fits, indicating that there is no significant metallicity dependence in the PL residuals. The flatness of these relations hints that the source of additional dispersion in the \ocen PL relations may not be due to metallicity, but in fact due to other evolutionary effects such as the spread in age of its multiple populations. This is discussed further in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

Based on the $\gamma$ measurements we find here, there is no evidence for a metallicity dependence in any band. Even taking our most extreme $\gamma$ value, the maximum change in magnitude due to metallicity for a 1.2 dex [Fe/H] spread would be $0.172 \times 1.2 = 0.21$ mag, which is comparable to the observed scatter of the PL relation in [4.5].

%However, the dominant source of uncertainty in these fits is the metallicity measurements, with typical errors approaching $\sim 0.5$~dex, and systematic offsets between the photometric and spectroscopic systems that make them unsuitable for use as one catalogue. More accurate metallicities will be required to constrain any potential effect more precisely.

\subsection{Evolutionary Effects}
\label{sec:evolution}
While we find high upper bounds on the contribution of metallicity to the PL scatter in all infrared passbands, it is unlikely that this scatter is due to metallicity alone. \citet{1986A&A...169..111G} and \citet{1991ApJ...373L..43L}  demonstrate that RRL luminosity is dependent on the horizontal branch morphology as well as metallicity; it is also well known that \ocen contains RRLs in multiple evolutionary states \citep{2008MmSAI..79..342S, 2015A&A...577A..99N}. \citet{2015ApJ...808...50M} performed extensive theoretical studies of the effects of both RRL composition and evolutionary state on the position of the horizontal branch in the Hertzsprung--Russell (HR) diagram. In their figure 2 they present the HR diagram for a selection of models at a fixed composition for a range of evolutionary states, demonstrating a spread in 0.3~dex in bolometric luminosity between the least evolved, zero--age horizontal branch (ZAHB) mass RRL and the most evolved RRL. The RRL population in \ocen is thought to be comprised of (at least) two different populations --- the metal rich population being the less evolved ZAHB phase stars, with the more metal poor population in an advanced evolutionary state \citep{2016MNRAS.457.4525T}. This spread in evolutionary state \textit{in addition to} the spread in metallicity could create the additional dispersion observed in the \ocen PL relations. 

% Figures~\ref{fig:hband_spectro} and~\ref{fig:hband_photo} demonstrate the need for an additional evolutionary parameter. Both the $H$ and [3.6] bands show additional scatter in the \ocen PL relations above that which can be explained by the intrinsic dispersion and photometric uncertainties alone. Figures~\ref{fig:hband_spectro} and~\ref{fig:hband_photo} show the PL relations with the stars colour coded by metallicity. If metallicity were the dominant factor in the additional dispersion we would expect that the high metallicity points would sit on one side of the mean PL, with the low metallicity points on the other. This is not the case in either the $H$ or [3.6] bands; the metallicities appear to be randomly distributed about the mean PLs. This is a clear suggestion that the dominant effect contributing to the dispersion in the  \ocen PL relation is a spread in evolutionary state (i.e. age), rather than composition.

\subsection{Improvements to the Mid--IR PL Calibration}
\label{sec:improvements}

We note here a concern with the current adopted slopes for RRab and RRc variables at 4.5\um from \citet{2015ApJ...808...11N} (and to a lesser degree for the corresponding slopes for the 3.6\um PL relations). There are two indications that the slopes may not be correct. First, we note that the slope of the respective PL relations as a function of wavelength is not monotonically increasing with increasing wavelength, as expected as the slope asymptotically approaches the slope of the wavelength-independent period-radius relation. For the RRab variables a relatively smooth trend is observed. However, for the RRc variables the situation is less clear. While the three near-infrared slopes follow the RRab trend in lock--step, the slope at 3.6\um is very shallow with respect to the value expected from a smooth extrapolation from the shorter wavelengths, and then at 4.5\um the slope becomes unexpectedly large. This pattern of behaviour is unphysical.

Future data, beyond the scope of this paper, will be required to improve upon these slopes; however, we note that the slopes at 3.6\um and 4.5\um should both be around $-2.80$, suggesting that 3.6\um will be steeper by 0.09 (a 5\% adjustment) and that the slope at 4.5\um  will be flatter by 0.18 (an 6\% adjustment). Second, the correspondence of the 3.6 and 4.5\um magnitude residuals from their respective PL relations would be made tighter if the 4.5\um PL relation for the RRc variables were made shallower, or the 3.6\um slope made steeper, or both, as suggested above.

The issue of whether this difference in slope is due to differences in metallicity between \ocen and M4 \citep[the calibrating sample in][]{2015ApJ...808...11N}, or to another effect such as the discrepant period distributions of the samples, or a difference in analysis technique, requires an independent sample of RRL at a single metallicity, and as such cannot be answered with the \ocen sample. 

\mjdcomment{Well uh. Do we want to say anything about GAIA now?}
Results from the Gaia mission \citep{1996A&AS..116..579L} are expected to improve the overall characterisation of the RRL PL relation dramatically. Trigonometric parallaxes and spectrophotometric metallicities of Galactic RRLs from Gaia will increase the number of high quality calibrators for the infrared PL relations by an order of magnitude \citep[Scowcroft et al. 2016b, in prep., Beaton et al. 2016, in prep.]{2012MNRAS.426.2463L}. 

In addition to the calibration of the slope and absolute zero--point of the RRL PL relation, Gaia will also provide important insights regarding \ocen. Gaia will observe many of the RRL in \ocen \citep{2002ASPC..265..415B}, providing 0.2\% parallaxes and spectrophotometric metallicities for the individual stars. Combining the photometric data presented here with the Gaia sample of high--quality parallaxes and consistent metallicities we will be able to further constrain the effect on the mid--IR PL relation.

We also anticipate that the NIRCam instrument on {\em JWST} \citep{2005SPIE.5904...21B, 2006SSRv..123..485G} will provide substantial improvements over IRAC for investigations of this nature. The NIRCam filters F356W and F444W will provide data in passbands comparable to IRAC's [3.6] and [4.5] at an order of magnitude higher resolution (0.065 arcsec/pixel), which will significantly decrease photometric error due to crowding and therefore allow us to obtain data for the full sample of RRL in \ocen. With the parallaxes and differential metallicities from Gaia, and the high precision photometry from {\it JWST}, studies of \ocen will allow us to explore the effects of metallicity and evolutionary effects on the RRL populations of globular clusters.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We derive a mean dereddened distance modulus for \ocen of ${\langle \mu_0 \rangle = 13.743 \pm 0.026}$ with reddening ${E(B-V) = 0.138 \pm 0.044}$ using distance moduli derived from RRab PL relations in $JHK_s$, [3.6], and [4.5]. Using the mean of RRab and RRc distance moduli in the same passbands, we derive a mean dereddened distance modulus of ${\langle \mu_0 \rangle = 13.789 \pm 0.018}$ with reddening ${E(B-V) = 0.084 \pm 0.030}$. The value found using RRab alone is in better agreement with those in the literature \citep[e.g.][]{2002ASPC..265...95L, 2006ApJ...652..362D}.

We also constrain the contribution of metallicity on the dispersion of the RRL PL relations by considering the variances associated with each component of the PL relation. We find that at most metallicity contributes 0.106 and 0.140~mag in dispersion to the [3.6] and [4.5] RRab PL relations respectively. Converting these values into $\gamma$, the PL relation metallicity coefficient, we find high upper limits compared to theoretical predictions for all infrared wavelengths. 

When deriving $\gamma$ empirically using the residuals from the RRL PL relations and the individual metallicities of the stars, we find $\gamma$ values consistent with zero at all infrared wavelengths. We thus conclude that the upper limits derived in Section~\ref{sec:dispersions} are likely a combination of metallicity and evolutionary effects due to the evolutionary spread of the populations in \ocen.  

%, quantified as $\gamma = \Delta \text{mag} / \Delta [\text{Fe/H}]$, to the scatter of the \ocen PL relations by subtracting the variances of the intrinsic scatter and photometric error from the observed PL variance and taking the square root of the result, and dividing that by the standard deviation of the distribution of metallicity values. We also measure $\gamma$ directly using the slope of the linear fit to the PL residuals vs. [Fe/H].

April 27 2015: VS added calibrated allframe photometry for field 2
- Used a single PSF for all epochs of a single epoch/channel
- All calibration steps now have python scripts associated with them (see smhash photometry repo)
- Photometric zero points changed from previous version (mistake in zero points in VS documentation)
- application of location correction is multiplicative, not division.
- Final photometry in .raw files, final match files in .mch files

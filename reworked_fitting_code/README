Omega Cen PL and Distance Fitting Code Explanation

Package requirements (all should be available via pip install):
    NumPy
    SciPy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Prettyplotlib

Script summaries, in order of how they should be run:

- pl_plot_theoretical
    Reads from uncrowded_photometry.csv
    Does PL fitting and makes PL plot using theoretical PL relations imported from pls_theo.py
    Saves fitted distances as final_data_files/dist_phot_theo.csv
    Copies uncrowded_photometry.csv and adds columns with residuals, saves as uncrowded_withresid.csv

- pl_plot_m4
    Reads from uncrowded_photometry.csv
    Does PL fitting and makes PL plot using M4 PL relations imported from pls_m4.py
    Saves fitted distances as final_data_files/dist_phot_m4.csv
    Copies uncrowded_photometry.csv and adds columns with residuals, saves as uncrowded_withresid_m4.csv

- distance_plot_theoretical
    Reads from from final_data_files/dist_phot_theo.csv
    Uses functions from reddening_laws.py to fit true distance modulus + reddening value to 
    uncorrected average distance moduli
    Plots distance moduli for abs, cs, and averages with extinction curve

- distance_plot_m4
    Reads from from final_data_files/dist_phot_m4.csv
    Uses functions from reddening_laws.py to fit true distance modulus + reddening value to 
    uncorrected average distance moduli
    Plots distance moduli for abs, cs, and averages with extinction curve

- make_csv_with_metallicities
    Merges uncrowded_withresid.csv and uncrowded_withresid_m4.csv and adds columns with metallicity
    values from sollima_2006.cat and rey_2000.cat, saves as uncrowded_everything.csv

- metallicity_residual_plots
    Reads from uncrowded_everything.csv
    Makes plots of metallicities vs. residuals, phot vs spect metallicities, period vs color,
    and metallicity vs. color

Scripts that are not run directly:

- pls_theo
    Definitions of theoretical PL relation functions for use in pl_plot_theoretical

- pls_m4
    Definitions of m4 PL relation functions for use in pl_plot_m4
    (same as theoretical for JHK, m4 for 3.6 and 4.5 only)

- reddening_laws
    Defines reddening laws for multiple wavelength regimes
    Fits multiwavelength distance moduli to reddening laws and returns a true distance modulus,
    true A_v value, and respective errors
    Used in distance_plot_theoretical and distance_plot_m4

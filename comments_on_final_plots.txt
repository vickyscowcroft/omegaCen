 -- if you remove the high outlier at [Fe/H] = -2.0, how does the slope change?
 
delta_feh_4p5_phot.pdf
 -- Same as above -- this star may be dominating the slope. What does it look like if you remove it?

 -- What is the standard deviation of these points? 
 -- Instead of just plotting a 1-1 line, can you fit a line both ways (use phot as the x variable, then spec as the x variable), then plot them both on the same plot. This should give you information about whether it's they're actually well-correlated or not. This fitting has a proper name but I don't remember what it is.
 
slope_interecept_params
-- Can you add an extra column with standard deviation of the points around the fit please?

multiwavelength_distance_samestars_phot.pdf and spec
-- Can you plot the reddening law on here too please?
